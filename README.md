# My-Python-Learing
Im learing Python and Linux in the same time. To maximize time I decided to put stuff I have already learned in Python to create a search tool that will be used as a reminder for important Linux command.

LCST - is a simple Linux commands reminder. Simple while loop is used to acces groups of known linux commands.
Notes.py - is a prototype note script - it takes a txt file reads it or allow for making notes that are date stamped.
